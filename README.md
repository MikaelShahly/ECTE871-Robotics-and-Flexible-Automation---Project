# ECTE871-Robotics-and-Flexible-Automation---Project
This project, Nut Tightening Task Automation, was developed as part of the coursework for ECTE871 - Robotics and Flexible Automation at the University of Wollongong. It was a collaborative group project (Group 11) aimed at designing and simulating a robotic solution for an industrial nut-tightening task. The assignment required integrating robotic kinematics, trajectory analysis, and automation concepts to accomplish the specified objectives.

## Project Description
The task involves automating the insertion and tightening of four nuts onto four horizontal bolts. The workflow includes:

- Picking washers and nuts from a spring-activated parts feeder.
- Loading washers onto bolts before securing the nuts.
- Performing these operations using a computer-controlled manipulator designed with specified constraints and requirements.

## Key Features
- Robot Design: A robotic arm with 5 degrees of freedom (3 prismatic and 2 revolute joints) was designed to meet task-specific requirements.
- Kinematic Modeling: The Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) method was applied to derive the robotâ€™s kinematic model.
- ARTE Simulation: The robotic arm was modeled and simulated using the ARTE MATLAB library to verify its operation and optimize trajectories.
- Trajectory Analysis: Joint velocities and trajectories were analyzed to ensure efficient motion.

## Instructions
To run the simulation and analyze the results:
1) Clone the repository to your local machine.
2) Install MATLAB with the ARTE library.
3) Load the provided parameter files into ARTE.
4) Execute the MATLAB scripts for kinematic analysis, trajectory planning etc
